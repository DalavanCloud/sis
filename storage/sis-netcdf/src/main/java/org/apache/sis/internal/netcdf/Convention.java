/**
 * Extends the CF-Conventions with some conventions particular to a data producer.
 * By default, Apache SIS netCDF reader applies the <a href="http://cfconventions.org">CF conventions</a>.
 * But some data producers does not provides all necessary information for allowing Apache SIS to read the
 * netCDF file. Some information may be missing because considered implicit by the data producer.
 * This class provides a mechanism for supplying the implicit values.
 * Conventions can be registered in a file having this exact path:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>META-INF/services/org.apache.sis.internal.netcdf.Convention</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p><b>This is an experimental class for internal usage only (for now).</b>
 * The API of this class is likely to change in any future Apache SIS version.
 * This class may become public (in a modified form) in the future if we gain
 * enough experience about extending netCDF conventions.</p>
